# plane-and-ships-game
My first project done as a Alura student, 
thanks to the knowledge acquired after completing some courses offered there, 
in particular the course "Lógica de programação: laços e listas com JavaScript",
by Teacher Guilherme Lima, making some additions/adjustments to the code 
with the help of the Youtube Channel @codingwithmrward1648!
It's a game with animations, scores and sounds, using P5 Js (https://editor.p5js.org/).
So its about how to add images in P5 Js, to learn how to use lists,arrays,
to understand how to avoid duplicate code with loops, 
and to develop the programming logic.
